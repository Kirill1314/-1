          <h3>The Eye Of Cthulhu</h3>
          <p>
            The Eye of Cthulhu (Eye of Cthulhu) is the boss. It is called with the help of a suspicious eye, which can
            be made from 6 lenses on a demonic altar or a bloody altar, as well as found in a golden chest. You can only
            summon the Eye of Cthulhu at night. Also, if the player's maximum health is 200 or more health units, the
            player has more than 10 units of protection and more than 3 NPCs live in the world, there is a chance that
            he will appear himself, while the player will receive a message: "You feel an evil presence watching you"
            (You feel someone's evil attention ...). After his murder, a Dryad may come to you
          </p>

          <h3>The Devourer of Worlds</h3>
          <p>
            The Eater of Worlds is a boss that is summoned either with the help of worm food in the territory of
            corruption, or after the destruction of three shadow spheres.

            Skeletron Prime is a hardcore mechanical boss added in Update 1.1. It is a complicated version of Skeletron.

          <h3>Twins</h3>
          <p>
            Gemini (The Twins) is a mechanical boss, a hardcore version of the Eye of Cthulhu. Caused by a mechanical
            eye. Since version 1.2, there is a small chance that they themselves will appear after the inscription:
            "It's going to be a terrible night..."(«This is going to be a terrible night…»)

            Each eye has its own individual health. Red is a Retinizer, shoots purple lasers, and green is a Spasm,
            shoots a cursed flame. They are connected by a thread of flesh that connects them together. When killing or
            moving the eyes a long distance from each other, the thread connecting them will not be visible.

            A lunatic sectarian is summoned when killing 4 sectarians who appear at the entrance to the Dungeon after
            defeating the Golem. After defeating him, Lunar events begin.Although the Sectarian Lunatic has only one
            phase, his attacks become stronger with decreasing health. He can fly using his attacks: fireballs,
            creating an electric sphere that shoots lightning in a circle, creating a giant snowflake that lets ice
            fragments into the player, shadow lights and shooting 5 destructible spheres.

          <h3>MoonLord</h3>
          <p>
            Moon Lord is the final boss of Terraria in version 1.3.0.5, from which the most powerful items in the game
            fall out. Defeating him alone can be a very difficult challenge even with the best equipment. He appears
            after defeating all 4 Heavenly Towers during Lunar Events, or after using the Heavenly Seal.

            The Moon Lord has 2 arms and a head that should be "killed" by dealing damage to the eyes on them. When
            all three eyes are destroyed, the core opens — the heart, which also needs to be destroyed. The hands
            shoot homing projectiles and can summon phantom versions of the True Eye of Cthulhu to throw them at the
            player.
