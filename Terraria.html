      The private company Re-Logic, founded by Andrew Spinks and Finn Bryce, developed and published Terraria. Spinks
      started working on the game in January 2011.[19] The Microsoft XNA toolkit was used to create the game[20].
      Initially, Re-Logic employees were Andrew Spinks, who developed and programmed the game, Finn Bryce, who did
      graphic design with Spinks, and Jeremy Gerrett, who provided public relations at the development stage [21][22].
      However, after the release of Terraria, Finn Bryce, who is currently developing Starbound[23], and Jeremy
      Gerrett[22] left Re-Logic. The soundtrack, stylized as a chiptune, and sound effects were created by Scott Lloyd
      Shelley in his Resonance Array studio[24]. The composer used stereophony, which allows the player to determine
      which side of the monitor screen the sound is coming from[25]. Terraria was announced on April 18, 2011 — Re-Logic
      published a video on YouTube, which demonstrates the gameplay[26]. The game was released on May 16, 2011
      The character's origin story tells that he was once a brilliant but selfish surgeon. After his hands were
      seriously damaged in a car accident and he was no longer able to perform operations, Stephen Strange went on a
      journey around the world in search of healing and met an Ancient One; becoming one of the old wizard's disciples,
      he becomes a practitioner of both mystical and martial arts. Along with the knowledge of many powerful spells,
      Strange possesses two magical artifacts — the cloak of levitation and the eye of Agamotto.

      After the release of Terraria, the development of the game has not stopped — Re-Logic is still releasing updates
      that complement the current content and fix various bugs. On December 1, 2011, a major update 1.1 was released,
      the main innovation of which was the "complex mode", as well as errors in the procedural generation of the game
      world were fixed and dynamic lighting was improved[29][10]. On February 21, 2012, the developers announced that
      they would not continue active development of the game, but later released a final update that fixed the bugs.
      Andrew Spinks stated that he wants to improve his skills as a programmer and game designer outside of Terraria
      development, and apply them in another project[30][31][32]. However, on January 23, 2013, Re-Logic started
      developing Terraria again when Andrew Spinks asked the community to come up with new ideas for their
      implementation in future updates[33][34].

      On April 3, 2013, ahead of the release of Update 1.2, Andrew Spinks published images of new biomes and natural
      structures[35][36]. Game designer and artist Jim Tommy Mure took part in its development — according to him, he is
      responsible for updating sprites [37][36]. Initially, the release was scheduled for July[38], but later it was
      postponed to October 2013[39]. After nine months of development, on October 1, 2013, Re-Logic released update 1.2,
      which changed almost every detail of Terraria[40]. On October 3, 2013, during an interview with Rock, Paper,
      Shotgun with Andrew Spinks, a sequel was announced — Terraria 2. Spinks stated that in it he wants to get endless
      game worlds in which the player can travel indefinitely [41][42]. Later, a themed update dedicated to Halloween
      and Christmas was released[43][44]. On October 2, 2014, Terraria was released in the service GOG.com without using
      DRM[45].

      On June 26, 2015, a major 1.3 update was released, significantly complementing the existing content. The
      developers took into account the inconvenient connection to the network game, and with this update they added new
      network modes[46]. On July 23, 2015, Terraria was released for macOS and Linux operating systems[47]. On September
      6, 2016, version 1.3.3 was released, the main innovation of which was the improvement of visual effects from
      snowfall and the addition of a sandstorm[48][49].

      In the summer of 2019, the developers announced that the 1.4 update with the subtitle Journey's End (from English
      — "The end of the journey") it will be the last major update for the game — after it, Re-Logic will release only
      minor fixes. Update 1.4 should add 800 new items to the game, new opponents and bosses, an improved weather change
      system and a new system for generating the game world, a new level of difficulty, as well as a mini-golf game[50].
